SAFE SPACE -therapy application app
The main aim is to Empower mental health with technology
## Overview
**SafeSpace** is a user-centered, web-based therapy support platform designed to enhance access  not only to mental health services but also emotional and spiritual growth as well. Built for educational institutions and community mental health initiatives, SafeSpace provides a secure and personalized experience for individuals seeking therapeutic support, feedback tools, and a connection to trusted professionals.

The platform combines thoughtful UI/UX design with essential functionalityâ€”such as therapist selection, satisfaction surveys, and mapped location pinsâ€”to ensure support is not only available, but also accessible, reliable, and meaningful.

## Healing Through Connection, Technology, and Empathy
